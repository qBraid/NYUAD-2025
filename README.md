# NYUAD Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World: Focusing on Quantum Computing (QC) and Aritificial Intelligence (AI)

https://hackathon.nyuad.nyu.edu/2025-program/

## Getting started
Step 1. Enter the code provided on discord and on the google sheet on https://account.qbraid.com/account-details to receive credits and access to Azure devices.

Step 2. Use [qBraid SDK pre release](https://pypi.org/project/qbraid/0.9.6.dev20250425155658/)

```bash
pip install qbraid==0.9.6.dev20250425155658
```

Step 3. Use the launch on qBraid button to open in qBraid Lab or use our [VSCode extension qBraid Quantum Console](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qBraid.quantum-console) to [monitor jobs](https://docs.qbraid.com/lab/user-guide/quantum-jobs) or use [pre installed environments](https://docs.qbraid.com/lab/user-guide/environments).


## Technical challenge

_Create a program that applies one or more quantum algorithms to a social good
problem of your choice._


**Quantum algorithm examples**:

- Shor's algorithm
- Grover's search
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

**Social good topic examples**:

- Healthcare
- Science (e.g. AI, cryptography, biochemistry)
- Environment (climate)
- Education & Literacy
- Food Securities
- Crisis & Public Safety
- Financial Modeling
- Gaming

**Implementation requirements**:

- Must utilize quantum hardware available through Microsoft Azure
  Quantum.
- Must utilize an Azure simulator or emulator made available via access code.
- You are also free to use any technology which allows you to solve the
  challenge.

**Device pricing and availability**:

- [Azure Quantum pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-quantum/)
- [qBraid Azure supported devices](https://docs.qbraid.com/home/pricing#quantum-computers-on-demand)

# qBraid/Azure Device Tutorials

Here, we provide useful tutorials on how to use qBraid, along with tutorials
on quantum computing, using Azure Quantum.

[QAOA to solve QUBO using Pasqal](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/blob/develop/tutorials/applications/QAOA%20and%20QAA%20to%20solve%20a%20QUBO%20problem.ipynb)

[Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)

Note: Teams will have access to QPUs only if they have successfully demonstrated the following:
- a. Ran and passed on emulator or simulator.
- b. Passed the syntax checker, if avaialble.
- c. The cost is reasonable, we believe this will be a good exercise on understanding how to calculate your costs. View Azure pricing [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/pricing?tabs=tabid-paygo%2Ctabid-paygoPasqal%2Ctabid-H2).
- d. The project is fully fleshed out and compelling. We aim to update on a case by case basis.
